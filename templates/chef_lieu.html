				<p>
					(Okap or Kap Ayisyen in Haitian Creole), formerly Cap-Français or Cap-Henri, often called Le Cap, is a commune in Haiti, the capital of the Nord department and the arrondissement of Cap-Haïtien.

				<h3 class="underTitle">Geography</h3>
				<p>
					Cap-Haitien is a port city located on the northern coast of the Republic of Haiti and was considered in the nineteenth century as the safest port thereof. The city is located on the west coast of Cap-Haitien Bay, at the mouth of the Haut-du-Cap River and is dominated by the mountain of Jean Jean which rises to 718 meters above sea level. To the west of the agglomeration of Cap-Haitien stretches the Acul bay in depth. In the outskirts of the city of Cap-Haitien is the city of Vertières where the battle of Vertières took place in 1803.
				</p>
				<h3 class="underTitle">Demography</h3>
				<p>
					The municipality is populated by 249,541 inhabitants1 (2009 census estimate), including 155,505 inhabitants for the city itself.
				</p>
				<h3 class="underTitle">History</h3>
				<p>
					It is to the east of this city, formerly called Guarico by the Amerindians, that Christopher Columbus built a fort called La Navidad with the debris of Santa María, shipwrecked on Christmas night in the year 1492. It leaves on place 39 of his men who, before the return of Columbus, were all killed by the natives, exasperated by their acts of violence. The fort, which had been burnt down, will never be rebuilt and will be forgotten, until vestiges were discovered by a peasant in 1977. During the French colonial period, the city, founded in 1670 by a dozen adventurers under the command of Pierre Lelong, is known as Cap-Français. The city was then the capital of the colony of Santo Domingo before the Haitian Revolution. In May 1695, the Cape was attacked and looted by the English, in retaliation for the Jamaica expedition, led in 1694 by Jean-Baptiste du Casse. In 1739, Fort Picolet was built, composed of two superimposed batteries, a covered way and a wall along the coast. Nearby, there are other fortifications: Fort Magny (in which General Magny is buried and defended by the Gris-Gris battery), Fort Belly, Fort-aux-Dames and Fort Saint-Joseph. The population numbered 15,000 in 1790. The city was burnt down for the first time from June 21 to 23, 1793 during a Franco-French confrontation between republican troops and white separatists. On February 5 or 6, 1802, during the landing of the Santo Domingo expedition, General Henri Christophe, facing French military superiority through a scorched earth policy, started the fire that destroyed the city entirely2 . Slums, poverty, insecurity and crime remain important phenomena in Cap-Haitien.
